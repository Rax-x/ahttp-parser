# ahttp-parser

I built this library because sometimes I work with **Arduino** and often there's a need to parse **HTTP** messages.
Many existing libraries on **the internet** either offer too many features (**too much overhead**), 
or they are simply not easy to use or integrate **into** projects.

This library is written in **C99** and **implements** just the basic features, following **RFC 2616**.

>[!WARNING]
> This library is still **WORKING IN PROGRESS**!
